###Why this repository?
> Challenging myself to solve a interview question perday starting with leetcode. To improve myself, attended Microsoft and google interview didn't clear the interview rounds, because I was not upto mark. Mistake is upon me. Trying to correct it.

#### [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

* [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) - Solution [java](https://github.com/dmadan86/LeetCode/blob/master/src/com/leetcode/TwoSum.java) 

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

* [Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/) - Solution [java](https://github.com/dmadan86/LeetCode/blob/master/src/com/leetcode/Add_Two_Numbers.java)

You are given two linked lists representing two non-negative numbers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
```
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
```

* [Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/) - Solution [java](https://github.com/dmadan86/LeetCode/blob/master/src/com/leetcode/lengthOfLongestSubstring.java)

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Examples:
```
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

* [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/) -Solution [java](https://github.com/dmadan86/LeetCode/blob/master/src/com/leetcode/findMedianSortedArrays.java)

There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

**Example 1:**
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

**Example 2:**
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```

#### [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/) - Solution [java](https://github.com/dmadan86/LeetCode/blob/master/src/com/leetcode/TwoSum.java) 

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```
